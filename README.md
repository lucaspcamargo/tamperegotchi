This is a finland-themed clone of the most popular franchise of virtual pets.
Basic actions like feeding, cleaning, and playing game swith your pet are implemented. Also sending and receiving pets to a server and sharing it via a code.
The game is not finished and likely never will be! But it is a great testbed for playing with Qt 5 and QML.
